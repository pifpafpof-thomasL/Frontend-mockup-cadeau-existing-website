# Frontend-mockup-cadeau-existing-website

Let's try to re-engineer the UX of an existing website
=========================
* the goal is to produce the wireframes one for smarphone, and one for desktop PC/Mac
* and then to produce the smartphone mockup
* we have been using pencil https://github.com/prikhi/pencil to create the html output (it is exported as single page)
* the buttons on the mockup are the dynamic parts i.e. they are linking the application pages
